# RedOakTireandWheel-Website

Red Oak Tire & Wheel, Inc. opened in January 2001 in Red Oak, TX. Since that time, they have offered complete lines of new & used tires, custom wheels, batteries, and general automotive services. They strived to place customer service as the goal of their business. The company permanently closed in November 2021.

This is the website I made for them. It was made with HTML, Bulma CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for form validation.
